# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project is about cleaning the data collected from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of the dataset can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Using the script

Before using the script (run_analysis.R), here are some instructions:

1. Data for the project should be downloaded from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. The file should then be unzipped, and the working directory to be changed to the location of the unzipped files. This can be done using the setwd() function.

Now, you can execute the run_analysis.R script. This will produce a file called "tidy_data_set.txt". Details on the output can be found in Codebook.md
